If you want to actually send emails in production, you'll need to set up an SMTP server or use a transactional email service. 
For example, to use Gmail's SMTP server, you would use settings like these:
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your-email@gmail.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your-email-password'
Replace 'your-email@gmail.com' and 'your-email-password' with your actual Gmail credentials. 
Note that for Gmail, you might need to use an "App Password" instead of your regular password.
If you're planning to use this in production, you'll want to set up a proper email backend. Popular choices include:
-Using a transactional email service like SendGrid, Mailgun, or Amazon SES.
-Setting up your own SMTP server.
-Using your hosting provider's email service, if available.
